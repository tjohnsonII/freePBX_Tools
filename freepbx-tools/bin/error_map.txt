# FreePBX Internal Error Map

## Purpose and Scope
This document centralizes the highest-impact runtime failures observed across FreePBX and Asterisk logs so on-call engineers can triage issues quickly. It distills the critical indicators outlined in the FreePBX/Asterisk log analysis guide and maps them to the tooling shipped in this repository for rapid verification.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L253-L344】【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L1-L210】

## Quick Reference Matrix
| Category | Typical Log Signature | Impact | Primary Logs | First Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Database connectivity failure | `Failed to connect to database`, `MySQL server has gone away` | FreePBX cannot read configuration; inbound/outbound calls may fail | `/var/log/asterisk/full`, `/var/log/httpd/error_log` | Run the database failure grep to confirm and capture the last 20 entries for escalation.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L257-L264】 |
| Trunk offline / registration loss | `Registration.*failed`, `qualify: Endpoint.*is now Unreachable` | External calling over the affected trunk will fail | `/var/log/asterisk/full` | Execute the trunk health grep and snapshot the failing endpoints.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L268-L276】 |
| Authentication storm / SIP attack | `NOTICE.*failed to authenticate`, `SECURITY.*failed authentication` | High risk of brute-force attacks or blocked endpoints | `/var/log/asterisk/full`, `/var/log/fail2ban.log` | Pull the latest security events and enumerate offending IPs.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L292-L299】【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L163-L210】 |
| Queue abandon spike | Multiple `ABANDON` events, abandon rate > 20% | Customer hang-ups before answer, SLA breach | `/var/log/asterisk/queue_log` | Use the queue analyzer to calculate abandon rate and capture current wait statistics.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L280-L288】【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L109-L161】 |
| Codec negotiation failure | `Unable to negotiate codec`, `no compatible formats` | Calls fail with fast busy or immediate hangup | `/var/log/asterisk/full` | Filter recent logs for codec negotiation errors and identify the involved endpoints.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L315-L322】 |
| Voicemail storage issue | `Failed to create voicemail`, `disk full`, `no space left` | New voicemail drops fail to record | `/var/log/asterisk/full` | Gather the last voicemail-related failures and verify disk capacity on the voicemail partition.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L338-L344】 |
| Channel utilization ceiling | `core show channels count` near limit | New calls may be rejected once capacity is reached | Asterisk CLI | Run the core channel count and correlate with concurrent call analytics.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L305-L311】 |

## Response Playbooks

### 1. Database Connectivity Failure
1. Run `grep -i "database.*fail\|mysql.*error" /var/log/asterisk/full | tail -20` to confirm active failures and collect the most recent stack traces.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L257-L264】
2. Check whether the automated log analyzer already flagged the incident to gather structured details for incident tickets.【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L51-L214】
3. Escalate to the database owner with the captured log snippet and note any concurrent GUI errors from Apache.

### 2. Trunk Offline / Registration Loss
1. Execute `grep -E "Registration.*failed|qualify.*Unreachable|trunk.*unavailable" /var/log/asterisk/full | tail -50` to identify the affected trunks and timestamps.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L268-L276】
2. Re-run the automated analyzer to capture a summarized incident report for the NOC dashboard.【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L82-L104】【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L218-L248】
3. Notify the carrier or network team with the offending endpoints and begin active monitoring for registration recovery.

### 3. Authentication Storm / SIP Attack
1. Use `grep -i "failed.*auth\|SECURITY" /var/log/asterisk/full | tail -50` to validate the volume of failed logins and determine whether fail2ban is responding.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L292-L299】
2. If the log analyzer shows more than 20 recent failures, collect the summarized IP list it produces for blocklisting.【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L168-L190】
3. Coordinate with security operations to block abusive IPs upstream and document the incident.

### 4. Queue Abandon Spike
1. Inspect the last 100 queue events using `tail -100 /var/log/asterisk/queue_log | grep -c ABANDON` to quantify the surge.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L280-L288】
2. Run the queue performance analyzer to retrieve current abandon rate and wait time metrics for the incident log.【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L109-L161】
3. Alert the contact center supervisor with current wait times and recommended staffing adjustments.

### 5. Codec Negotiation Failure
1. Filter the full log with `grep -i "codec.*negotiat\|no compatible format" /var/log/asterisk/full | tail -20` to isolate the failing endpoints.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L315-L322】
2. Document the codec pair in the incident record and coordinate with device owners for configuration alignment.

### 6. Voicemail Storage Issue
1. Run `grep -i "voicemail.*fail\|disk.*full\|no space left" /var/log/asterisk/full | tail -20` to capture failing mailbox IDs.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L338-L344】
2. Include disk utilization metrics from the voicemail partition in the escalation notes.

### 7. Channel Utilization Ceiling
1. Execute `asterisk -rx "core show channels count"` during the incident window to confirm saturation.【F:LOG_ANALYSIS.md†L305-L311】
2. Cross-check the output with active call analytics to recommend scaling actions or call shedding.

## Automation Hooks
The `freepbx_log_analyzer.py` utility encapsulates these checks, summarizes severity (Critical/High/Medium), and surfaces supporting log excerpts that can be attached to incident tickets. Integrating it into scheduled jobs or the FreePBX dashboard ensures proactive detection of the issues in this map.【F:freepbx-tools/bin/freepbx_log_analyzer.py†L29-L248】
