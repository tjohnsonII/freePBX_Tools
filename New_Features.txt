Based on your workspace and the context of your web scraping scripts (such as scrape_123net_docs.py, scrape_123net_docs_selenium.py, and related tools), here are targeted recommendations to improve your web scraping program:

1. Robust Error Handling
Add try/except blocks around all network and parsing operations.
Log errors with enough context (URL, exception type, stack trace).
Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient network failures.
2. Headless Browser & Anti-Bot Evasion
If using Selenium, always run in headless mode for automation.
Randomize user agents and add delays between requests to mimic human behavior.
Use proxies or rotating IPs if scraping at scale or from sites with rate limits.
3. Modularize and Reuse Code
Break scraping logic into reusable functions: fetch_page, parse_html, extract_data, save_results.
Use a configuration file for URLs, credentials, and scraping parameters.
4. Data Validation and Cleaning
Validate extracted data before saving (e.g., check for missing fields, correct formats).
Normalize and clean data as part of the pipeline.
5. Logging and Progress Tracking
Add logging for start/end of scraping, number of items scraped, and any failures.
Optionally, add a progress bar (e.g., with tqdm) for long-running scrapes.
6. Output Consistency
Save results in a consistent, structured format (JSON, CSV, or database).
Include timestamps and source URLs in your output for traceability.
7. Respect Robots.txt and Legal Boundaries
Check and respect robots.txt where appropriate.
Avoid scraping sensitive or protected data.
8. Testing and Maintenance
Write unit tests for parsing and extraction functions.
Document the scraping process and any site-specific quirks in your README.
9. Performance Improvements
Use asynchronous requests (e.g., with aiohttp or asyncio) for faster scraping if the site allows.
Batch writes to disk to reduce I/O overhead.
10. Future-Proofing
Abstract selectors and parsing logic so they can be easily updated if the site layout changes.
Store scraping rules in a config or external file.
